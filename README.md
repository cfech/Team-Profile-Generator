Using a combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node Js, and the inquirer, path and fs node packages to create a generator for a basic team. The specific types of team member are built using classes and constructors. You use This app by typing "node app.js" in the command line and answering the requisite questions. You are able to make 1 manager and any combination of any number of interns and engineers. After you are done an html file will be generated with the users input and put in the output folder.
